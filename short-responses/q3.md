# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static Assets are unchanging files delivered to the client exactly as they are stored on a server. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, videos, fonts, and documents. For React projects, we need to "build" our project to generate static assets (convert .jsx files to .js files). To generate these static assets, you must run npm run build.
